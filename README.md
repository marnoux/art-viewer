## To change the artists, update the default state in App.js with another valid artist.
### A list of valid artists can be found in components --> Artist

## Unit tests
  To stay within the 4 hour time box,  I did not add unit tests with great functionality. Most of the tests are just tests to verify if the tested component can be rendered without crashing.  If given extra time, I would happily add more robust and functional unit tests.

To run the unit tests, run the following

### `npm test`
